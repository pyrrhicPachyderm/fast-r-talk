\note[itemize]{
	\item
	There are a lot of us here who have to run code that takes a long time.
	We can save a lot of time by making it faster.
	
	\item
	R isn't naturally a fast language.
	But small changes can make a lot of difference.
	Just last week, I cut a program down from over 60 hours to just 1 hour by rewriting just one arithmetic function in it.
	
	\item
	We'll leap in with an example, to prove a point.

		row_sums_apply <- function(mat) {
			apply(mat, 1, sum)

	<<>>=
		row_sums_loop <- function(mat) {
			result <- rep(0, nrow(mat))
			for(i in 1:ncol(mat)) {
				result <- result + mat[,i]
			}
			return(result)
		}

\note[itemize]{
	\item
	Explain both pieces of code.
	
	\item
	First uses apply, where 1 means apply over rows.
	
	\item
	Second creates an empty column with \texttt{rep}, then loops over each column and adds it on.
	
	\item
	Ask audience opinion on which will be faster.
	Get a poll.

\note[itemize]{
	\item
	Explain that we've created some dummy data.
	
	\item
	Counter to popular wisdom, the loop is faster.
	Popular wisdom is not wrong; loops are \emph{usually} slower.
	
	\item
	Will explain why this case is different later.
	For now, note that it pays to know what's going on under the hood.
